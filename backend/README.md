# üöÄ **Optimizing CampusX Performance with Redis**(On Going)

CampusX leverages **Redis** to improve app performance by caching frequently accessed data and using queues for background tasks. WebSockets are used to notify the frontend in real time.

## **‚ö° Caching with Redis for Faster API Responses**

Caching helps reduce the load on the database by storing frequently accessed data in memory. In CampusX, Redis caching is used for:

- **User Profiles:** When a user profile is requested, it is first checked in Redis. If found, it is returned instantly; otherwise, it is fetched from the database and stored in Redis for future requests.
- **Recent Posts & Comments:** Instead of querying the database every time, recent posts and comments are cached in Redis for quick retrieval, reducing query times.

This approach significantly improves API response times and enhances user experience.

---

## **‚è≥ Using Redis Queue for Heavy API Tasks**

Background tasks that require time to process are handled using a Redis queue to avoid blocking API responses. In CampusX, Redis queues are used for:

- **User Registration:** When a user signs up, their registration details are added to a queue, processed in the background, and then saved to the database.
- **Post Creation:** When a user creates a post, the request is immediately acknowledged, and the actual saving process is handled in the background.
- **OTP Sending:** OTPs are queued and processed asynchronously to avoid delays in the authentication process.

By using Redis queues, CampusX can handle a large number of requests efficiently without slowing down the user experience.

## üö´ **Rate Limiting with Redis** to prevent spam in posts

## **üì° Real-Time Updates Using WebSockets**

WebSockets are used to send real-time updates to the frontend for various actions. In CampusX, WebSockets notify users about:

- **OTP Status:** Once an OTP is processed and sent, the frontend is updated in real time.
- **New Posts:** Users get instant notifications when a new post is created.
- **Other Notifications:** Important events like comments, likes, or mentions are delivered in real time using WebSockets.

This ensures users stay updated without needing to refresh the page.
